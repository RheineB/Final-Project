# Mental health impact of the internet

Investigate Suicide Research Dataset.

## 800,000 people die from suicide every year

Globally, close to 800,000 people die from suicide every year. That’s one person every 40 seconds. Due to the stigma associated with suicide – and the fact that it is illegal in some countries – this figure is also likely to be an underestimate, with some suicides being classified as unintentional injuries.

```

I decided to talk about this matter for my final project in my Ironhack bootcamp to see if the internet has a great impact to one's mental health. Following this, I made this project to show what I've learnt in my 9week intensive bootcamp course using machine learning, web scaping and data cleaning.

## Research Questions
##### You could check the attacked files in this repository for further information.

1. Which country has the most suicides? Which country has the least suicides?

2. What is the relationship between gender and the number of suicides?

The average female suicide rate is 4.31160463576159
The average male suicide rate is 15.629664238410593

We could see that male suicide is almost 4x higher than the women.
"According to literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates are explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, risk-taking behavior, economic status, and individualism."

3. Is there a relation about people with internet access, eating disorders and depression?

Wwe can observe that there is a relationship between internet access and eating disorder, in which we can state that the use of internet platforms such as the social media can affect our perspective.

4. How is the relation between internet access and suicide rates by country?

We can see that there is no relation between these two variables.

5. Which age group are more likely to suffer deaths by self harm?

We can observe with this data that the elderly people with ages above 70 has the highest death by self harm ratio.

## Mental health awareness
Although the general perception of mental illness has improved over the past decades, studies show that stigma against mental illness is still powerful, largely due to media stereotypes and lack of education, and that people tend to attach negative stigmas to mental health conditions at a far higher rate than to other diseases and disabilities, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease.

Stigma affects not only the number seeking treatment, but also the number of resources available for proper treatment. Stigma and misinformation can feel like overwhelming obstacles for someone who is struggling with a mental health condition. Here a few powerful things you can do to help:

Showing individuals respect and acceptance removes a significant barrier to successfully coping with their illness. Having people see you as an individual and not as your illness can make the biggest difference for someone who is struggling with their mental health.
Advocating within our circles of influence helps ensure these individuals have the same rights and opportunities as other members of your church, school and community.
Learning more about mental health allows us to provide helpful support to those affected in our families and communities. (https://www.pinerest.org/newsroom/articles/mental-health-awareness-blog/)
